# ZX Spectrum Emulator/Debugger/Assembler/Disassembler

A remake of my old Nx emulator I wrote a few years ago, but this time written
with some more modern approaches and in the C programming language.

This project will help me disassemble old ZX Spectrum games to help me convert
them to the ZX Spectrum Next.

- Built-in editor and assembler that assembles directly to memory in the

  be later assembled in the emulator and is compatible with Odin on the ZX
  Spectrum Next.
